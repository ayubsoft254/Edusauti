# Users App Debug Report

## Summary
The `src/users` Django app had several critical bugs that have been identified and fixed. This report documents all issues found and their solutions.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Field Name Mismatch in Views** ❌ **FIXED**
- **Files**: `src/users/views.py` (lines 479, 878)
- **Issue**: The code was trying to access `user.subscription_expires_at` but the User model has `subscription_end_date` instead
- **Error**: `AttributeError: 'User' object has no attribute 'subscription_expires_at'`
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed `user.subscription_expires_at = None` to `user.subscription_end_date = None`
  - Fixed in both `cancel_subscription` view and `cancel_subscription_api` function

### 2. **Authentication Logic Issue** ❌ **FIXED**
- **Files**: `src/users/serializers.py` (line 50)
- **Issue**: The login serializer was trying to authenticate with `authenticate(email=email, password=password)` but Django's default authenticate function expects `username` and `password`
- **Error**: Authentication would fail because the authenticate function doesn't recognize the `email` parameter
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified to first get the user by email, then authenticate using the username
  - Added proper error handling for non-existent users

### 3. **Missing Model Method** ❌ **FIXED**
- **Files**: `src/users/models.py` (SubscriptionHistory model)
- **Issue**: The serializer was trying to call `get_payment_method_display()` on SubscriptionHistory model, but the `payment_method` field didn't have choices defined
- **Error**: `AttributeError: 'SubscriptionHistory' object has no attribute 'get_payment_method_display'`
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `PAYMENT_METHOD_CHOICES` to the SubscriptionHistory model
  - Updated the payment_method field to use choices

## Technical Details

### Changes Made:

#### 1. `src/users/views.py`
```python
# Before:
user.subscription_expires_at = None

# After:
user.subscription_end_date = None
```

#### 2. `src/users/serializers.py`
```python
# Before:
user = authenticate(email=email, password=password)

# After:
try:
    user_obj = User.objects.get(email=email)
    user = authenticate(username=user_obj.username, password=password)
except User.DoesNotExist:
    user = None
```

#### 3. `src/users/models.py`
```python
# Before:
payment_method = models.CharField(max_length=50, blank=True)

# After:
PAYMENT_METHOD_CHOICES = [
    ('demo', 'Demo'),
    ('api', 'API'),
    ('stripe', 'Stripe'),
    ('paypal', 'PayPal'),
    ('bank_transfer', 'Bank Transfer'),
    ('credit_card', 'Credit Card'),
]
payment_method = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=PAYMENT_METHOD_CHOICES, blank=True)
```

## Code Quality Issues Identified (Already Fixed in Code)

1. **Datetime Handling**: The code had proper fixes for datetime/date comparisons
2. **Request Object**: The `request.User` vs `request.user` issue was already fixed
3. **Import Statements**: All necessary imports are present and correct

## Potential Runtime Issues Prevented

1. **Authentication Failures**: Users wouldn't be able to log in through the API
2. **Subscription Cancellation**: The cancel subscription functionality would crash
3. **Serializer Errors**: The invoice serializer would fail when trying to display payment methods

## Recommendations for Future Development

1. **Add Unit Tests**: The codebase would benefit from comprehensive unit tests to catch these types of issues
2. **Database Migration**: After the model changes, run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate`
3. **Error Handling**: Consider adding more robust error handling for edge cases
4. **Code Review**: Implement code review processes to catch field name mismatches

## Files Modified
- `src/users/views.py` - Fixed field name issues (2 locations)
- `src/users/serializers.py` - Fixed authentication logic
- `src/users/models.py` - Added payment method choices

## Verification
✅ All Python files compile successfully with no syntax errors
✅ Model field references are consistent across the codebase
✅ Authentication logic follows Django best practices
✅ Serializers have proper field mappings

## Next Steps
1. Run `python manage.py makemigrations users` to create migrations for the model changes
2. Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply the changes
3. Test the authentication flow
4. Test subscription cancellation functionality
5. Test the admin interface for subscription history
